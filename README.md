# Interactive data analysis/exploration using the Jupyter notebook and numpy/pandas

A presentation given by [@WillFurnass](https://twitter.com/willfurnass) to the [Python Sheffield user's group](https://twitter.com/pysheff) on 24th February 2015.

The slides were created as [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), which was then run to generate output for all Notebook cells before being converted to a [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentation using the [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/) utility (see `Makefile`).

The resulting Reveal.js presentation can be viewed on github [here](https://willfurnass.github.io/pyshef-jupyter-numpy-pres).
